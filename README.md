##Description

**eBae** is the Electronic Bachelor(ette) Auction Experience.  

## MVP

- The website will host one auction at a time, with Bachelor(ette)s listed for that event
- There will be two types of users: Admins and Bidders, which will log in through Facebook
- The admins will be able to personally add their list of bachelor(ette)s who are participating, with a basic bio and description of winning activities.
- The Bidders can direct-buy (not bid on) the bachelor(ette)s, which will utilize the Stripe API for payment processing.

## Full App

- Event coordinators can post their event to eBae to raise funds for their organization, along with a bio of the organization's history
- Bachelors and Bachelorettes can post their profile to the event, along with a bio and a decription of the activity that they will do with the auction winner (like dinner, adventures, sports, etc)
- Users can click an event, and place bids on the Bachelor(ette)s 

## Stretch Goals

- User can see "Your Auctions" to keep track of the auctions they are participating in
- User gets an email alert if they have been outbid
